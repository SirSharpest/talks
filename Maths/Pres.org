* Intro
** What was the data set
*** We focused on looking at a Î¼CT image dataset
- Its output (morphometric) data.
- This was part of a Wheat (/Triticum aestivum/) drought experiment.

** Experiment Details
*** Drought Experiment Parameters

* Working as a group
** Working as a group
*** Insight
- I was already very familiar with the data
- Which  meant I was too close to it to be "open-minded"

** Benefits of discussing the data
*** Explaining teaches
- Going through and explaining data makes you re-evaluate it
- Stops you taking data for granted!
- Helps you recognise your own mistakes and misunderstandings


*** Analysis is a living and evolving process
- "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
  - Kent Beck /et al/.
** Group discussion
*** Suggestions
- Our group suggested that Principal Component Analysis would be well suited to the data
  - It may provide a method of looking at which traits are most effected by the experiment treatments
- Another idea was using MANOVA to explore mean differences in treatments


* Presenting Data
** Presenting the data
*** Interest in how best you could convey information
- We looked at the data from a visualisation point of view
- How you could show details on morphometric phenotypes in concise charts, plots or diagrams
- We knew that some of the data couldn't be used, but not /why/
** Showing the errors in the data

** Showing relationships of traits

* Feedback from audience
** Feedback from audience
*** Suggested Models
- Multiple Regressions
- Simple linear models
- More suggestions to use MANOVA
*** Similar with the group's initial ideas
 - Which shows how different fields instinctively tackle/solve problems


* Thanks

** Thanks for listening!
*** Any Questions?
